# Tumblr Boiler Plate with NPF Support
Created by UndeadOrion -- https://undeadorionart.tumblr.com/

Free to use and alter for free themes. Contact me if you wish to use this as a base of a paid theme and we can work something out. 

This is meant to be a bare bones basic theme that brings together both old and new post formats. Currently the JavaScript is very simple. It identifies post types and applies it first to a visible label for readability, then applies a class to the post itself. There are a scant few divs that need to be maintained for the code to work. The specifics have been marked in comments in the HTML code.
